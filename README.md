# NestJS-Microservices-Docker-RabbitMQ

## Scripts folder

In some folder after the root we can see a folder called `scripts`. Inside that folder we have lot of `.sh` scripts.

To be able to run those commands we should do the following: 

```bash
cd scripts
chmod a+x filename.sh
```

If you want to run those commands you **MUST** be inside scripts folder.
